2019 - Personal Summer Project UE4 4.22

**_STILL VERY MUCH A WIP_**

### Background
It's no secret that I am a huge fan of the programming-puzzle genre of games.
Since I had some spare time on my hands, I wanted to make a game inspired by the game that got me into the genre, KOHCTPYKTOP.

However, I don't simply want to re-create the game, I want to add some features and elements of my own.
Also, the slight delay in the verification between the input and output always bugged me beyond belief.

So this project will try to hit 2 birds with one stone.
